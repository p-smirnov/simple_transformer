# Simple Transformer Repo

This is a repo where I reimplement the transformer architecture from scratch, only loosely following other existing implementations. 

The main point of this is to have a codebase that I can hack around and understand which tricks and optimizations are actually relevant to my use case of MIL on histopathology slides, and to understand more of the dark art behind working transformer models. 

This might not end up as the prettiest or most efficient code base, but should improve over time.
